if you have legitimate reason to, it sucks when you leave.

- Sacred Temple used to be a storage facility but now a main HQ, heavily defended, expect AA and reinforcements if you don't hit them hard and fast.
- There may be unmarked objectives, because this is only our intelligence but we will update squads dynamically as we recieve information.
